# Module-6-Assessment-2
Auto4Sale

The website has the list of Featured vehicles and a list of cars for sale with their information. 
If you click on the images from the list of cars for sale you go to a page where you can see more images of the specific car.
I added a image slider on the home page so you can be able to see the images of the cars featured on the website. 
The website also has a contact page as stated. It also has page where you can see all the cars offered. 
Please just look at it and it way more different than the website for Assessment 1 but it do have elements that a similar. All the bugs a removed.
